      Binary rEvolution is composed of an international group of researchers teaming up to study the current population of X-ray binaries and predict their role as progenitors of double compact mergers.
      <br><br>
      We have worked on several studies ranging from measuring the natal kick in X-ray binaries to simulating the evolution of stars in binaries using hydrodynamics.
      <br><br>
      Some products of our work are available to the community; you can browse the newest catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy as well as use our database of MESA binary simulations in the menu above.
      <br><br>
      Our current projects are tied to the formation of magnetars in binary channels and to the preparation of LISA for the future observation of compact binaries.
